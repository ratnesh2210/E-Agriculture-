      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h4><p>An initiative to built a common platform for producers and customers where both the users can perform their activities with transparency.
Providing a indiscriminate financial opportunity to both producers(farmers) and the consumers.
</h4></p>
      <p>E-Agri makes it simple for farms, farm cooperatives, and local food artisans to streamline working with wholesale buyers such as restaurants, schools, corporate kitchens, retails stores, and more. Lessening the administrative work that comes with each order helps producers create a more successful relationship with their buyers and can help them work with more buyers overall. Buyers benefit by quick access to local products, real time knowledge of what is available, and an easy way to work with local producers.</p>
